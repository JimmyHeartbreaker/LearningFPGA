@N: MT204 |Auto Constrain mode is disabled because clocks are defined in the SDC file
@N: BW103 |The default time unit for the Synopsys Constraint File (SDC or FDC) is 1ns.

@N: MT320 |This timing report is an estimate of place and route data. For final timing results, use the FPGA vendor place and route report.
@N: MT322 |Clock constraints include only register-to-register paths associated with each individual clock.
